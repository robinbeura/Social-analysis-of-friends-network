Friends is a popular American sitcom, which aired from September 22, 1994, to May 6, 2004, lasting ten seasons.

The sitcom revolves mainly around 6 friends – Rachel Green, Phoebe Buffay, Monica Geller, Ross Geller, Joey Tribbiani and Chandler Bing.

Given that we are huge fans of this show, we wanted to see how these major 6 characters along with the other minor characters form distinct communities, and if we could identify the most important characters for each of these communities.
In doing this, we ignore the connections formed between the 6 major characters.
